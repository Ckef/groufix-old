# Groufix

## Introduction

Groufix is a hardware accelerated 2D/3D graphics engine built upon OpenGL 3.2 and up. It is written in C and runs on Windows, Unix and OS X. The library has no external dependencies other than windowing libraries which come with the platforms. On OS X and Unix Xlib (X11) is used. Alternatively OS X can use Cocoa, which is planned for future development. On windows the native libraries from Windows 2000 and up are used.

The main repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ckef/Groufix).
