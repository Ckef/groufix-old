# Groufix

## Introduction

Groufix is a cross platform hardware accelerated 2D/3D graphics engine built in C using OpenGL. The library has no external dependencies besides native windowing APIs and OpenGL to access the GPU. Desktop OpenGL is supported from 3.2 and up. OpenGL ES is supported from 3.0 and up.

Supported targets and their APIs _(windowing, OGL extension and/or OGL version)_:

* __Unix__,    X11 (Xlib), GLX, OGL _(working)_
* __OS X__,    X11 (Xlib), GLX, OGL _(working)_
* __Windows__, Win32 (Windows XP and up), WGL, OGL _(working)_
* __OS X__,    Cocoa, CGL, OGL _(planned)_
* __Android__, NDK, OGL ES _(considered)_

The main repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ckef/Groufix).

## Building

A Makefile is shipped with the project, run make without a target to view all build targets. All necessary OpenGL headers are shipped with the project as well. Platform files (such as windows.h or xlib.h) are not shipped as they should be made available by the platform itself. Once the library is built, link against it using `-lGroufix`. Use the library in your code by simply including `<groufix.h>`, all core functionality will be made available through that file.

### Dependencies

To compile Groufix, you need the standard headers for your platform and OpenGL. These headers should come with the appropriate GPU drivers. When developing for OGL ES, the library should be built specifically for it. When building for OGL ES, `GFX_GLES` should be defined by the compiler to compile the correct extension loading mechanism (in most cases this is done automatically through the build target).
