# Groufix

## Introduction

Groufix is a cross platform hardware accelerated 2D/3D graphics engine built in C using OpenGL. The library has no external dependencies besides native windowing APIs and OpenGL to access the GPU. Desktop OpenGL is supported from 3.2 and up. OpenGL ES is supported from 3.0 and up.

Supported targets and their APIs _(windowing, OGL extension and/or OGL version)_:

* __Unix__,    X11 (Xlib), GLX, OGL _(working)_
* __OS X__,    X11 (Xlib), GLX, OGL _(working)_
* __Windows__, Win32 (Windows XP and up), WGL, OGL _(working)_
* __OS X__,    Cocoa, CGL, OGL _(planned)_
* __Android__, NDK, OGL ES _(considered)_

The main repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ckef/Groufix).

## Building

A Makefile is shipped with the project, run make without a target to view all build targets. All necessary OpenGL headers are shipped with the project as well. Platform files (such as windows.h or xlib.h) are not shipped as they should be made available by the platform itself. Once the library is built, link against it using `-lGroufix`.

To compile Groufix, you need the standard headers for your platform and OpenGL. These headers should come with the appropriate GPU drivers. When developing for OGL ES, the library should be built specifically for it, `GFX_GLES` should be defined by the compiler to compile the correct extension loading mechanism (in most cases this is done automatically through the build target).

## Usage

Once Groufix is built, it can be used in your code with `#include <groufix.h>`. All core functionality will be made available through that file. Make sure the include directory in this repository is listed as a directory to search for header files. This directory contains all public header files necessary to use the library. Before using the engine, it should be intialized with a call to `gfx_init`. After being done with the engine, it should be terminated with a call to `gfx_terminate`.

All names starting with `gfx`, `_gfx` and `GFX` are reserved by Groufix, using such a name for any variable or function in conjunction with the engine might result in redefinitions.

### Threading

_The library is not thread safe_. All windowing and hardware functionality should be executed from the same thread at all times. Due to the complex nature of GPU interaction it is easier and safer to execute all graphics related operations on the same thread. However, there are components in the engine which are specifically designed to be used in multiple threads. Note, no other functionality is guaranteed to work concurrently.

* __Buffer Mapping__, `gfx_buffer_map` returns a pointer which may be used from within any location in the program, as long as it is valid.

### Termination

As said before, when done with the engine, it should be terminated with a call to `gfx_terminate`. It is important to make this call after the engine is initialized and used. This call will free all hardware (GPU) related memory and free all windows. This means the connection to both the GPU and windowing manager is lost. It will also clear the error queue, as it will be irrelevant.

_It will not free any other resources_. Windows are the only user allocated objects which are automatically freed, any other objects must be freed by the user. To make sure everything is freed properly, every create method must be followed up by the appropriate free method and every init method must be followed up by the appropriate clear method.
